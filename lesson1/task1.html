<h1>Shape of my heart-Sting</h1>
    <p><strong>He deals the cards as a meditation</br>
    And those he plays never suspect</strong></br>

        He doesn't play for the money he wins</br>
    He doesn't play for the respect</br>

       He deals the cards to find the answer</br>
    The sacred geometry of chance</br>

    I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier</br>
    I know that the clubs are weapons of war</br>
    I know that diamonds mean money for this art</br>
    But that's not the shape of my heart</br>
    He may play the jack of diamonds</br>
    He may lay the queen of spades</br>
    He may conceal a king in his hand</br>
    While the memory of it fades</br>

    I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier</br>
    I know that the clubs are weapons of war</br>
    I know that diamonds mean money for this art</br>
    But that's not the shape of my heart</br>
    That's not the shape, the shape of my heart</br>

    And if I told you that I loved you</br>
    You'd maybe think there's something wrong</br>
    I'm not a man of too many faces</br>
    The mask I wear is one</br>
    Those who speak know nothing</br>
    And find out to their cost</br>
    Like those who curse their luck in too many places</br>
    And those who smile are lost</br>
